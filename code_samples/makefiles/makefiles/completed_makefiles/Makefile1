# In this Makefile, we define three targets:
# 1) .PHONY (used to list things that aren't filenames)
# 2) hello.exe (the program we want to compile)
# 3) clean (name of our cleanup recipe )

#clean refers to a recipe, not a file.  Include it in .PHONY
.PHONY: clean

# hello.exe requires hello.c and hellofunc.c to compile
hello.exe: hello.c hellofunc.c
	@echo "Compiling hello.exe."
	icc -I . hello.c hellofunc.c -o hello.exe

# When make clean is run, remove compiled files
clean:
	rm -f *.o
	rm -f hello.exe
