#Notes for changing LD_LIBRARY_PATH

1)  DO THIS ONCE, before adding pkg1/lib or pkg2/lib to your LD_LIBRARY_PATH
export LD_SAVE=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
export LIB1=$PWD/pkg1/lib
export LIB2=$PWD/pkg2/lib

2)  Now, when experimenting with the path, use either:
	LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LIB1:$LD_SAVE
	or
	LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LIB2:$LD_SAVE

Note (1):  $PWD always contains name of the current working directory

Note (2):  The syntax LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$PKG1:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH etc. will 
also work, but your path will become very long very quickly as you
switch back and forth between having package 1 or 2 at the top of
your LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
